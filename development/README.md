# Emergancy access issues - Sergey Troyatsky

1. During emergency access user must be able to perform actions which
   cannot be performed unless authorized for emergency access. I changed
   "Dentist" not to be able to "Add new patient" to the system and upon
   granting "Emergency Access" permission "Add new patient" did not
   appear. If user is granted "Emergency Access" he must get admin privileges

2. Emergency Access must disable itself upon login off. So when I
   granted a, for example, Maria emergency access she must have it only
   for one-time use. When she will log off and login in again she must
   not have emergency access.
